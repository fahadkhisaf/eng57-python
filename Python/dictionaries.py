# Dictionaries
# defination and syntax
# a dictionary is a data structure, like a list, but organised with key and not index.

# Defining a dictionary
# They are organized with 'key':'value' pairs.
# for example 'zebra':'an african wild animal that looks like a horse but has stripes body'.
# This means you can search data using keys, rather than index.

# syntax
# my_dictionary = {'key':'value'}

# getting value out
# print(dictionary_name[value])

# reassigning one value
# dictionary_name['value'] = "new assigned key"

# new value pair
# dictionary_name['value'] = "new massage"

# .keys()
# print(dictionary_name.key())

# .values()
# print(dictionary_name.values())

# .items()
# print(dictionary_name.items())
