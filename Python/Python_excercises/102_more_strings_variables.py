# Practice strings
# Welcome to Sparta - exercise

# Version 1 specs - with concatenation
# define a variable name, and assign a string
colour = "red"
# prompt the user for input and ask the user for his/her name
name = input("What is your name?  ")
# re assign the original variable this this input


# use concatenation to print a welcome message and use methods to format the name/input (remove white spaces)
print(("hello" + " " + name + "" + ", we are welcome to have you!").strip())
# Version 2 - with interpolation

# ask the user for a first name, save it in a variable

# ask the user for a last name, save it in a variable

# use interpolation to print the message


# Calculate year of birth
# age = int(input('How old are you?'))
# birthday_gone = input('Has your birthday passed?  yes/no')
# if birthday_gone == 'yes':
#     birthday_gone = 0
# else:
#     birthday_gone = 1
#     birthday_gone = 2020 - age - birthday_gone
# gather details on age and name

# print something like
# OMG <person>, you are <age> years old so you were born in <year>
